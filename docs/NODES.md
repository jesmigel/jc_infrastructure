# NODES
* Only proceed if [requirements](./REQUIREMENTS.md) has been met.
* Unique VM's are to be deployed consisting of a kubernetes cluster and a proxy node

## Prerequisite - VM specifications
* The VM specifications are stated in [vagrant_variables.yaml](../platform/vagrant/vagrant_variables.yaml)
* Refer to the [infrastructure](../INFRASTRUCTURE.md) document for the default specifications

There are errors in the configuration of this machine. Please fix
the following errors and try again:

* The host path of the shared folder is missing: ./data/nginx/certs
* The host path of the shared folder is missing: ./data/sharedfolder

# The error above is caused by specified folders added 
#   to .gitignore. They are excluded due to contents 
#   being unwanted to be pushed upstream

# The error is fixed by executing the below
